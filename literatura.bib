  abstract  = { Due to globalization growth, learning a second language is a necessity to develop in an increasingly demanding multicultural environment. However, at present we still find that some traditional methodologies are still being applied for teaching, which represents a problem for current students, also called digital natives, because these methodologies should adapt to this digital age of technology and knowledge. To solve this problem, a digital resource for foreign language learning was developed taking into account competitiveness and gamification as bases to motivate students and engage them into the course. The objective of this tool is to improve the processing of theoretical information obtained making use of a virtual environment which has competitive activities and gamification elements such as: obtaining medals for completing tasks, user's progress bar and ranking according to the scores obtained, so that students are motivated and improve their learning... },

  abstractnote = {This research examined the relations of social media addiction to college students’ mental health and academic performance, investigated the role of self-esteem as a mediator for the relations, and further tested the effectiveness of an intervention in reducing social media addiction and its potential adverse outcomes. In Study 1, we used a survey method with a sample of college students (N = 232) and found that social media addiction was negatively associated with the students’ mental health and academic performance and that the relation between social media addiction and mental health was mediated by self-esteem. In Study 2, we developed and tested a two-stage self-help intervention program. We recruited a sample of college students (N = 38) who met criteria for social media addiction to receive the intervention. Results showed that the intervention was effective in reducing the students’ social media addiction and improving their mental health and academic efficiency. The current studies yielded original findings that contribute to the empirical database on social media addiction and that have important theoretical and practical implications.},

  abstract  = {The learning process can be improved through the incorporation of evolving information and communication technologies to teaching. But it is not enough to use cutting-edge technology. The focus must be in promoting the development of skills that traditional teaching cannot adequately address. In this way, mobile devices, particularly smartphones and tablets, present exciting opportunities today. These devices, largely used by students, allow access to information in a ubiquitous way -- anytime, anywhere. This ubiquity, aligned with other mobile learning features -- such as high memory capacity, built-in video cameras, voice recording capabilities, and geolocation capabilities, among others -- addresses several foreign language learning needs, in the modality known as mobile language learning. Play is a human activity used to entertain, teach, and transmit culture. Recently, games have been studied in a systematic way, where game elements are extracted and applied in corporate and educational situations. In mobile learning, game strategies -- known as gamification -- are often used to enrich the student experience, fueling motivation and promoting meaningful learning. In order to achieve the best results, it is important for the teacher, or other learning experience designer, to be knowledgeable of gamification elements and their application when creating mobile language learning activities. This chapter highlights the main elements of gamification that can be exploited for teaching languages, and it examines three experiences of language teaching trough mobile learning. It also analyzes how these experiences exploit gamification strategies to promote student engagement in the learning. Understanding how gamification strategies improve student learning in these experiences is important in order to advance the pedagogical and technological research of mobile language learning.},
