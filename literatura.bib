abstract="The learning process can be improved through the incorporation of evolving information and communication technologies to teaching. But it is not enough to use cutting-edge technology. The focus must be in promoting the development of skills that traditional teaching cannot adequately address. In this way, mobile devices, particularly smartphones and tablets, present exciting opportunities today. These devices, largely used by students, allow access to information in a ubiquitous way -- anytime, anywhere. This ubiquity, aligned with other mobile learning features -- such as high memory capacity, built-in video cameras, voice recording capabilities, and geolocation capabilities, among others -- addresses several foreign language learning needs, in the modality known as mobile language learning. Play is a human activity used to entertain, teach, and transmit culture. Recently, games have been studied in a systematic way, where game elements are extracted and applied in corporate and educational situations. In mobile learning, game strategies -- known as gamification -- are often used to enrich the student experience, fueling motivation and promoting meaningful learning. In order to achieve the best results, it is important for the teacher, or other learning experience designer, to be knowledgeable of gamification elements and their application when creating mobile language learning activities. This chapter highlights the main elements of gamification that can be exploited for teaching languages, and it examines three experiences of language teaching trough mobile learning. It also analyzes how these experiences exploit gamification strategies to promote student engagement in the learning. Understanding how gamification strategies improve student learning in these experiences is important in order to advance the pedagogical and technological research of mobile language learning.",
